Technologies Used in Smart PhoneBook:
C Programming Language: The project was developed using the C programming language, focusing on basic input/output operations, string handling, and memory management.
     Arrays: Arrays were used to store multiple contacts, each consisting of a first name, last name, telephone, and cellphone number.
     Structures: The struct data type was used to organize and manage contact information efficiently.
     String Functions: Functions like scanf, strcmp, and printf were utilized to handle string inputs, comparisons, and output formatting.
     Loops & Control Structures: for loops and switch statements were used to iterate through contacts, perform actions, and implement the menu system.
     This simple yet effective program demonstrates key programming concepts such as arrays, structures, and basic algorithms like sorting and searching.
